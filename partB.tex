In this section, we will investigate the stabilty of a Runge-Kutta method. We will study a stiff problem, the Robertson's equations. As a remainder, here is the problem : 

\begin{eqnarray*}
\textbf{x}' =& \left( \begin{array}{c}
-k_1x_1+k_2x_2x_3 \\ 
k_1x_1-k_2x_2x_3-k_3x_2^2 \\ 
k_3x_2^2 
\end{array} \right) \\
\textbf{x} =& \left( \begin{array}{c}
1 \\ 
0 \\ 
0 
\end{array} \right)
\end{eqnarray*}

The problem is stiff because of the practical values of the parameters. In this example, we have $k_1=0.04$, $k_2=10^4$ and $k_3=3 \cdot 10^7$.

\subsection*{B1. Constant stepsize experiment}
We are going to solve the Robertson's problem first with a constant stepsize.
